              <h5>Game Controls</h5>
              <p>The most important skill in Bike Unchained 2 gameplay-wise is to follow the track you're riding and anticipate the changes of a trail.
              </p>
              <p>You have intuitive touch-screen controls: to increase your speed on the downhill parts of a trail tap and hold your finger on the screen and release the pump on uphills to maintain the speed.</p>

              <br>
              <p>While this makes super easy game controls, this kind of gameplay requires a lot of skill to choose perfect moments to tap-and-hold and release your finger. Also you will have to explore the tracks in the game thoroughly to progress.</p>
